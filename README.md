#### Description
###### *WikiEats(Git-Hungry)*
>It's like Wikipedia but for recipes with some github on it. Users can upload recipes. Other uses can change the recipes and make their own branches to make the recipes more palatable to them. Users can rate recipes and comment on them to give their feedback. Categories for food people want to eat and people can search for what food they want. Users can make accounts and other users can rate their accounts and see their activity.

WikiEats


Two main files, one homepage and one site where you have to upload the recipie.


The way the Javascript works is that whenver someone clicks on the "Add new Step" button it adds a new step that they can then edit.

Currently having some trouble on that.


Aside from that, everything is self explatory, with one include header file.
